Episode 2
=========

Welcome back, Bill.

Conditional Computation
-----------------------

Dealing with pure values, you can use the `if` syntax:

    if boolean-expression
      then then-case-value
      else else-case-value

Dealing with monadic code, you can either refactor to deal with pure values or achieve monadic conditional computation with guards such as `when`:

    main = do
      when boolean-expression monadic-action

Note that in this case, you're really passing a monadic action to a function that chooses whether or not to evaluate it. This is not syntax.

Iteration
---------

Most of the time in Haskell, you will be dealing with lists or their ilk and your best option will be a functional combinator such as `fmap` or `filter`, or a more general list comprehension. For example:

    Prelude> x = map (**2) [1..10]
    Prelude> y = [ x**2 | x <- [1..10] ]

This is not helpful for repeating monadic actions, you wind up with a list of actions rather than a bunch of things having been done:

    Prelude> :t map (putStrLn . show) [1..10]
    map (putStrLn . show) [1..10] :: [IO ()] -- not useful

There are solutions though. The easiest one is to use `mapM` and relative `mapM_`:

    Prelude> mapM_ (putStrLn . show) [1..10]
    1
    2
    3
    ...
    10
    Prelude>

You can convert procedural iteration patterns to Haskell either by emulating with recursion or by generating sequences and using map/filter. In many cases there will be a combinator that expresses the iteration you're trying to achieve. Consult the documentation.

Homework
--------
Write a program to output a directory listing for the current directory.

    $ ./ls1
    .
    ..
    ls1.hs
    ls1.hi
    ls1.o
    ls1
    $ 

Modify the previous program to output a directory listing for each path supplied on the command line.

    $ ./ls2 . /tmp
    Contents of .:
    .
    ..
    ls2.hs
    ls2.hi
    ls2.o
    ls2
    
    Contents of /tmp:
    .
    ..
    aoeu.txt
    
    $ 

Modify the previous program to gracefully handle non-existent paths.

    $ ./ls3 nowhere-real
    Error: nowhere-real does not exist!
    
    $ 

Modify the previous program to handle a "-l" option for displaying more information:

     $ ./ls4 -l .
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 fusion  wheel  782934 Jan 13 13:02 ls4
    -rw-r--r--  1 fusion  wheel     718 Jan 13 13:02 ls4.hi
    -rw-r--r--  1 fusion  wheel     119 Jan 13 13:02 ls4.hs
    -rw-r--r--  1 fusion  wheel    3024 Jan 13 13:02 ls4.o
    
    $
